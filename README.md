CIC-NLP@DravidianLangTech 2025: Fake News Detection in Dravidian Languages

Misinformation is a growing problem for technology companies and society. Although there is a large body of related work on identifying fake news in predominantly resource languages, there is a lack of such studies in low-resource languages (LRLs). Because corpora and annotated data are scarce in LRLs, the identification of false information remains in the exploratory stage. Fake news detection is critical in this digital era to avoid the spread of misleading information. This study presents an approach to Detect Fake News in Dravidian Languages. Our team CIC-NLP work primarily targets Task 1, which involves identifying whether a given social platform news is original or fake. For the fake news detection problem, we used the mBERT model and utilized the dataset provided by the organizers of the workshop. In this section, we describe our findings and the results of the proposed method. The mBERT model achieved an F1 score of 0.853.
